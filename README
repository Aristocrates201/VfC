Visions for Change Groups and Events Listings Tool

Initial Design by Ian Barker, Chris Brock
Further Development by Simeon Jackson (simeon@simeonjackson.co.uk), Alan Cottey (mail@visionsforchangenorwich.org.uk)

Purpose: A web-based listings service for community groups to announce events and aims.

Design principles: 
-	Written in php and css with some javascript features. 
-	Content stored in a MySQL database. 
-	PHP code does not generally include location-specific (or implementation-specific) information so that it can be used universally.

Structure:
-	Landing pages have their own files (e.g. index.php or groups.php) with variables being passed by get (through the URL).
-	The principle code file is functions.php, which is included in all landing pages.  This file then includes some other functionality files.
-	The code for forms is generally within form_functions.php, which is then included from landing pages.
-	When forms are submitted, they are passed to submit.php, which deals with the request (a javascript request) and then either directs to another page, or feeds back data to the same page via javascript.
-	Interaction with the database is through functions defined in dblink.php.
-	Please ask Simeon for a copy of the database structure (this will at a later date be included as an SQL file!)

Features:
-	Home page with expanding content that can be edited from Admin page
-	Events listings with subscription service (email mailing list) and filters (by date, location)
-	Group listings
-	User registration:
	- any user can add groups and events
	- groups and events must be approved by a moderator
-	Admin page (accessible to moderators)
	- group moderation
	- event moderation
	- send email to subscribers
	- group and event archives (includes events in past, deleted groups & events)
	- list users and subscribers
	- edit homepage information
	
Notes:
-	Some location-specific information is still included in the php.  This needs to be flushed out.
-	The project was derived in Norwich following the Occupy camp in 2010, initially by Chris Brock and Ian Barker.  Hosting and development support was provided by Alan Cottey who enlisted Simeon Jackson to develop the code when the original programmers no longer had time to contribute. Simeon Jackson is now the principal contact for code development, whilst Alan Cottey is the principal contact for Visions for Change Norwich.
